# HW03 Exercises

## #1: Simple Layout
Create a two-column layout where:
- The left column takes up 30% of the page width.
- The right column takes up the remaining 70%.
- Add some text content in each column.
- Use relative and absolute units for width and padding.
- Add a background color to each column to visualize the structure.
- (You may encounter the position property if looking up how to do this, but I ask that you complete this exercise without the use of position and only what we learned in class.) 

## #2: Nested Containers: 
- Create four nested containers inside each other.
- The outermost container should span almost the full width of the page (apply some margin).
- Each subsequent container should be 50% of its parentâ€™s width.
- Give each container a different background color for visualization.

## #3: Flexbox Rows & Typography Hierarchy 
- Make 4 rows of 5 elements using "display: flex." 
Inside each of the 20 elements, add a heading, subtitle, and paragraph. 
- Use a web-safe font for "font-family" and use the property font-size to assign each element different values, establishing a visual hierarchy.
